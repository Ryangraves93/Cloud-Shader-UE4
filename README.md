# Cloud-Shader-UE4
A lecture I took to build a shader in UE4 by adding shader code to a material using a custom node. The process covered -

* HLSL Code within UE4.
* Implementing HLSL code into a custom node within the material graph.
* Saturated 3D perlin noise
* Creating a custom shader function the MaterialTemplate.ush for continous usage
* Ray marching to affect cloud density
